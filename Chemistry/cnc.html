        <h3 id="intro-coordination">Coordination Compounds</h3>
        <p>Coordination compounds are the backbone of modern inorganic and bio-inorganic chemistry and chemical industry. In the previous Unit, we learnt that the transition metals form a large number of complex compounds in which the metal atoms are bound to a number of anions or neutral molecules by sharing of electrons. In modern terminology, such compounds are called coordination compounds. The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding and molecular structure have provided insights into the functioning of these compounds as vital components of biological systems. Chlorophyll, haemoglobin and vitamin B₁₂ are coordination compounds of magnesium, iron and cobalt respectively. A variety of metallurgical processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents involve the use of coordination compounds. Coordination compounds also find many applications in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry.</p>

        <h3 id="werner-theory">5.1 Werner's Theory of Coordination Compounds</h3>
        <p>Alfred Werner (1866-1919), a Swiss chemist, was the first to formulate his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He proposed the concept of a <strong>primary valence</strong> and a <strong>secondary valence</strong> for a metal ion.</p>
        <p>Werner studied a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia. He observed that adding excess silver nitrate (\(\ce{AgNO3}\)) precipitated different amounts of chloride ions for different compounds, even though they were all derived from \(\ce{CoCl3}\).</p>

        <h4>Werner's Postulates</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In coordination compounds, metals show two types of linkages (valences) - <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>secondary</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary valences</strong> are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions. This corresponds to the <strong>oxidation state</strong> of the metal.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary valences</strong> are non-ionisable. They are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the <strong>coordination number</strong> and is fixed for a metal.</li>
            <li>The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different coordination numbers. This gives the complex a definite geometry.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Difference between a double salt and a complex</h4>
        <p>Both double salts and complexes are formed by the combination of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they differ in their behavior in solution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>double salt</strong>, such as Mohr's salt (\(\ce{FeSO4.(NH4)2SO4.6H2O}\)) or potash alum (\(\ce{KAl(SO4)2.12H2O}\)), dissociates completely into its constituent simple ions when dissolved in water.</li>
            <li>A <strong>complex compound</strong>, such as potassium ferrocyanide (\(\ce{K4[Fe(CN)6]}\)), contains a complex ion (\([\ce{Fe(CN)6}]^{4-}\)) that does not dissociate into its constituent ions (\(\ce{Fe^{2+}}\) and \(\ce{CN^-}\)) in solution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="definitions-coordination">5.2 Definitions of Some Important Terms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coordination Entity:</strong> A central metal atom or ion bonded to a fixed number of ions or molecules (ligands). It is usually enclosed in square brackets, e.g., \([\ce{CoCl3(NH3)3}]\), \([\ce{Ni(CO)4}]\).</li>
            <li><strong>Central Atom/Ion:</strong> The atom/ion to which a fixed number of ligands are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement. It acts as a Lewis acid. E.g., \(\ce{Ni^{2+}}\) in \([\ce{NiCl2(H2O)4}]\).</li>
            <li><strong>Ligands:</strong> The ions or molecules bound to the central atom. They are Lewis bases.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unidentate:</strong> Binds through a single donor atom (e.g., \(\ce{Cl-}\), \(\ce{H2O}\), \(\ce{NH3}\)).</li>
                    <li><strong>Didentate:</strong> Binds through two donor atoms (e.g., ethane-1,2-diamine (en), oxalate ion (ox)).</li>
                    <li><strong>Polydentate:</strong> Binds through several donor atoms (e.g., EDTA is hexadentate).</li>
                    <li><strong>Chelate Ligand:</strong> A di- or polydentate ligand that binds to a single metal ion, forming a ring structure. The resulting complex is called a chelate and is generally more stable than similar complexes with unidentate ligands (chelate effect).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ambidentate Ligand:</strong> A ligand that can coordinate through two different atoms (e.g., \(\ce{NO2^-}\) can bind through N (nitro) or O (nitrito); \(\ce{SCN^-}\) can bind through S (thiocyanato) or N (isothiocyanato)).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Coordination Number (CN):</strong> The number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is directly bonded. For \([\ce{PtCl6}]^{2-}\), CN=6. For \([\ce{Co(en)3}]^{3+}\), CN=6 (since 'en' is didentate).</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination Sphere:</strong> The central atom and the ligands attached to it, enclosed in square brackets. Ions outside the bracket are called counter ions.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination Polyhedron:</strong> The spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms directly attached to the central atom. Common shapes are octahedral, tetrahedral, and square planar.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxidation Number:</strong> The charge the central atom would carry if all the ligands were removed along with the electron pairs they shared with the central atom. It is represented by a Roman numeral in parentheses, e.g., Cu(I) in \([\ce{Cu(CN)4}]^{3-}\).</li>
            <li><strong>Homoleptic and Heteroleptic Complexes:</strong> Complexes with only one type of ligand are homoleptic (e.g., \([\ce{Co(NH3)6}]^{3+}\)). Complexes with more than one type of ligand are heteroleptic (e.g., \([\ce{Co(NH3)4Cl2}]^{+}\)).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="isomerism-coordination">5.4 Isomerism in Coordination Compounds</h3>
        <p>Isomers are compounds that have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms. There are two main types of isomerism in coordination compounds:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Structural Isomerism:</strong> Isomers have different bonds.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ionisation Isomerism:</strong> Difference in the counter ion, which can also act as a ligand. E.g., \([\ce{Co(NH3)5(SO4)}]Br\) and \([\ce{Co(NH3)5Br}]SO4\).</li>
                    <li><strong>Solvate (or Hydrate) Isomerism:</strong> Difference in whether a solvent molecule is a ligand or free in the crystal lattice. E.g., \([\ce{Cr(H2O)6}]Cl3\) and \([\ce{Cr(H2O)5Cl}]Cl2.H2O\).</li>
                    <li><strong>Linkage Isomerism:</strong> Arises with ambidentate ligands. E.g., \([\ce{Co(NH3)5(NO2)}]Cl2\) (yellow, N-bonded) and \([\ce{Co(NH3)5(ONO)}]Cl2\) (red, O-bonded).</li>
                    <li><strong>Coordination Isomerism:</strong> Interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic complex entities. E.g., \([\ce{Co(NH3)6}][\ce{Cr(CN)6}]\) and \([\ce{Cr(NH3)6}][\ce{Co(CN)6}]\).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stereoisomerism:</strong> Isomers have the same bonds but different spatial arrangements.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Geometrical Isomerism (cis-trans):</strong> Arises in heteroleptic complexes due to different possible arrangements of ligands. Common in square planar (\([\ce{MA2B2}]\)) and octahedral (\([\ce{MA4B2}]\)) complexes.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>cis-isomer:</strong> Similar ligands are adjacent.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <div class="note-box">
                            <p>Facial (fac) and Meridional (mer) isomerism occurs in octahedral complexes of the type \([\ce{MA3B3}]\). In the fac-isomer, the three identical ligands occupy the corners of one face of the octahedron. In the mer-isomer, they occupy positions around the meridian of the octahedron.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Optical Isomerism:</strong> Isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, called <strong>enantiomers</strong>. Such molecules are <strong>chiral</strong>. They rotate the plane of polarized light. Common in octahedral complexes with didentate ligands, e.g., \([\ce{Co(en)3}]^{3+}\) and cis-\([\ce{CoCl2(en)2}]^+\). The trans-isomer of \([\ce{CoCl2(en)2}]^+\) is achiral and optically inactive.</li>

        <h3 id="bonding-coordination">5.5 Bonding in Coordination Compounds</h3>
        <h4 id="vbt">5.5.1 Valence Bond Theory (VBT)</h4>
        <p>Proposed by Linus Pauling, VBT explains the formation and structure of coordination compounds based on hybridization. According to this theory:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The central metal ion provides a number of empty orbitals for the formation of coordinate bonds with ligands.</li>
            <li>These empty orbitals hybridize to form a set of new equivalent orbitals with a definite geometry (e.g., tetrahedral, square planar, octahedral).</li>
            <li>Each ligand has at least one orbital containing a lone pair of electrons.</li>
            <li>The empty hybrid orbitals of the metal ion overlap with the filled orbitals of the ligand to form a coordinate covalent bond (\(\sigma\) bond).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The magnetic properties of the complex help in predicting the type of hybridization.</p>
        <table class="styled-table">

        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Inner vs. Outer Orbital Complexes:</strong> For octahedral complexes, if the inner (n-1)d orbitals are used for hybridization, the complex is an <strong>inner orbital</strong> or <strong>low spin</strong> complex. If the outer nd orbitals are used, it is an <strong>outer orbital</strong> or <strong>high spin</strong> complex. This depends on whether the ligands are strong enough to force the pairing of d-electrons.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations of VBT:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>It involves many assumptions.</li>
            <li>It does not give a quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.</li>
            <li>It does not explain the colour of coordination compounds.</li>
            <li>It does not distinguish between weak and strong field ligands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="cft">5.5.4 Crystal Field Theory (CFT)</h4>
        <p>CFT is an electrostatic model that considers the metal-ligand bond to be purely ionic, arising from the interaction between the positive metal ion and the negative charge (or negative end of a dipole) of the ligands.</p>
        <p>In an isolated gaseous metal ion, the five d-orbitals are degenerate (have the same energy). When ligands approach, the degeneracy is lifted because the ligands' negative field repels the d-electrons. The pattern of this splitting depends on the geometry of the complex.</p>

        <h5>Crystal Field Splitting in Octahedral Complexes</h5>
        <p>In an octahedral field, the six ligands approach along the x, y, and z axes. The d-orbitals pointing along the axes (\(d_{x^2-y^2}\), \(d_{z^2}\)), called the <strong>\(e_g\) set</strong>, experience more repulsion and are raised in energy. The orbitals lying between the axes (\(d_{xy}\), \(d_{yz}\), \(d_{xz}\)), called the <strong>\(t_{2g}\) set</strong>, experience less repulsion and are lowered in energy.
        The energy separation between these two sets is the <strong>crystal field splitting energy, \(\Delta_o\)</strong>.

        <p><strong>Spectrochemical Series:</strong> Ligands are arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength (increasing \(\Delta_o\)). A part of the series is:
        \[ \ce{I- < Br- < SCN- < Cl- < F- < OH- < C2O4^{2-} < H2O < NCS- < NH3 < en < CN- < CO} \]
        Ligands at the low end are <strong>weak-field ligands</strong> (\(\Delta_o\) is small), and those at the high end are <strong>strong-field ligands</strong> (\(\Delta_o\) is large).</p>
        <p><strong>High-spin vs. Low-spin:</strong> For \(d^4\) to \(d^7\) configurations, the electron arrangement depends on the magnitude of \(\Delta_o\) compared to the pairing energy (P).
        <ul>
            <li>If \(\Delta_o < P\) (weak-field ligand), electrons occupy the \(e_g\) orbitals before pairing in the \(t_{2g}\) orbitals. This results in a <strong>high-spin</strong> complex.</li>
            <li>If \(\Delta_o > P\) (strong-field ligand), electrons pair up in the \(t_{2g}\) orbitals before occupying the \(e_g\) orbitals. This results in a <strong>low-spin</strong> complex.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>Crystal Field Splitting in Tetrahedral Complexes</h5>
        <p>In a tetrahedral field, the ligands approach between the axes. This inverts the splitting pattern: the \(t_2\) set is raised in energy and the \(e\) set is lowered. The splitting energy, \(\Delta_t\), is much smaller than in an octahedral field: \(\Delta_t = (4/9)\Delta_o\). Because \(\Delta_t\) is small, tetrahedral complexes are almost always <strong>high-spin</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4 id="bonding-carbonyls">5.6 Bonding in Metal Carbonyls</h4>
        <p>Metal carbonyls are compounds formed between metals and carbon monoxide (CO). The bonding in these complexes is unique and has both \(\sigma\) and \(\pi\) character. This is called <strong>synergic bonding</strong>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>M-C \(\sigma\) bond:</strong> Formed by the donation of the lone pair of electrons on the carbonyl carbon into a vacant orbital of the metal.</li>
            <li><strong>M-C \(\pi\) bond (back-bonding):</strong> Formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from a filled d-orbital of the metal into the vacant antibonding \(\pi^*\) orbital of carbon monoxide.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This synergic effect strengthens the metal-ligand bond. The back-bonding also weakens the C-O bond within the CO molecule.</p>
