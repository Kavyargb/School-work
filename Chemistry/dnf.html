        <h3 id="intro-d-f-block">The d- and f-Block Elements</h3>
        <p>The <strong>d-block</strong> of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3-12 in which the d orbitals are progressively filled. The <strong>f-block</strong> consists of elements in which 4f and 5f orbitals are progressively filled. They are placed in a separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table. The names <strong>transition metals</strong> and <strong>inner transition metals</strong> are often used to refer to the elements of d- and f-blocks respectively.</p>
        
        <h4 id="transition-metals-def">Transition Metals</h4>
        <p>There are four series of transition metals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3d series:</strong> Sc (Z=21) to Zn (Z=30)</li>
            <li><strong>4d series:</strong> Y (Z=39) to Cd (Z=48)</li>
            <li><strong>5d series:</strong> La (Z=57), Hf (Z=72) to Hg (Z=80)</li>
            <li><strong>6d series:</strong> Ac (Z=89), Rf (Z=104) to Cn (Z=112)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to IUPAC, transition metals are defined as metals which have an <strong>incomplete d subshell</strong> either in the neutral atom or in their ions. Because of this definition, Zinc (Zn), Cadmium (Cd), and Mercury (Hg) of group 12, which have a full \(d^{10}\) configuration in their ground state and common oxidation states, are not regarded as transition metals. However, they are the end members of the transition series and their chemistry is often studied alongside them.</p>

        <h4 id="inner-transition-metals-def">Inner Transition Metals</h4>
        <p>The f-block elements are divided into two series:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lanthanoids:</strong> The 14 elements following Lanthanum, from Cerium (Ce, Z=58) to Lutetium (Lu, Z=71). They involve the filling of the 4f orbitals.</li>
            <li><strong>Actinoids:</strong> The 14 elements following Actinium, from Thorium (Th, Z=90) to Lawrencium (Lr, Z=103). They involve the filling of the 5f orbitals.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="properties-d-block">General Properties of the Transition Elements (d-Block)</h3>
        <h4 id="electronic-config-d">Electronic Configuration</h4>
        <p>In general, the electronic configuration of the outer orbitals of d-block elements is <strong>\((n-1)d^{1-10}ns^{1-2}\)</strong>. The (n-1) stands for the inner d orbitals (penultimate shell). The relative stability of half-filled (\(d^5\)) and completely filled (\(d^{10}\)) orbitals leads to some exceptions in the expected configurations. The most notable examples in the 3d series are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chromium (Cr, Z=24):</strong> Expected: \([Ar] 3d^4 4s^2\). Actual: <strong>\([Ar] 3d^5 4s^1\)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Copper (Cu, Z=29):</strong> Expected: \([Ar] 3d^9 4s^2\). Actual: <strong>\([Ar] 3d^{10} 4s^1\)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This occurs because the energy difference between the (n-1)d and ns orbitals is very small.</p>
        <div class="question-block">
            <h5>Example: On what ground can you say that scandium (Z = 21) is a transition element but zinc (Z = 30) is not?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <p>Scandium has the ground state electronic configuration \([Ar] 3d^1 4s^2\). In its common +3 oxidation state, it is \(Sc^{3+}\) with a \(3d^0\) configuration. Since the ground state atom has an incompletely filled d orbital (\(3d^1\)), it is considered a transition element.</p>
            <p>Zinc has the ground state configuration \([Ar] 3d^{10} 4s^2\). Its only common oxidation state is +2, where the ion \(Zn^{2+}\) has a \(3d^{10}\) configuration. Since both the neutral atom and its common ion have a completely filled d subshell, zinc does not meet the IUPAC definition of a transition element.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="physical-properties-d">Physical Properties</h4>
        <p>Transition metals exhibit typical metallic properties like high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, and high thermal and electrical conductivity. They are generally hard and have high melting and boiling points.</p>
        <p><strong>Melting Points:</strong> The high melting points are attributed to the involvement of a greater number of electrons from both ns and (n-1)d orbitals in the strong interatomic metallic bonding. The melting point generally peaks near the middle of the series, where the number of unpaired d electrons is maximal, and then decreases as the electrons pair up.</p>
        <p><strong>Enthalpy of Atomisation:</strong> They have high enthalpies of atomisation, which follow a similar trend to melting points. This reflects the strong metallic bonding due to a large number of unpaired electrons. Metals of the 4d and 5d series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the 3d series.</p>
        <div class="question-block">
            <h5>Question: Why do the transition elements exhibit higher enthalpies of atomisation?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <p>This is due to the presence of a large number of unpaired electrons in their (n-1)d orbitals in addition to the ns electrons. These electrons participate in interatomic metallic bonding, leading to very strong bonds between atoms. A large amount of energy is required to break these bonds and convert the metal into gaseous atoms, resulting in high enthalpies of atomisation.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="atomic-radii-d">Variation in Atomic and Ionic Radii</h4>
        <p>The atomic radii of d-block elements decrease from left to right across a period. This is due to an increase in nuclear charge, which is not completely screened by the added electrons in the d orbitals (d electrons have poor shielding effect). However, the variation is small.</p>
        <p><strong>Lanthanoid Contraction:</strong> An important feature is the similarity in atomic radii between the 4d and 5d series elements. For example, Zr (160 pm) and Hf (159 pm) have almost identical radii. This is due to the <strong>lanthanoid contraction</strong>. The filling of the 4f orbitals before the 5d orbitals results in a regular decrease in size across the lanthanoid series. The 4f electrons are very poor at shielding the outer electrons from the increasing nuclear charge. This cumulative effect cancels out the expected increase in size from the 4th to the 5th period, making the 5d elements' radii very similar to their 4d counterparts. This similarity in size leads to great difficulty in their chemical separation.</p>

        <h4 id="ionisation-enthalpies-d">Ionisation Enthalpies</h4>
        <p>The ionisation enthalpies of d-block elements increase from left to right, but the increase is not as steep as for the main group elements. The values show some irregularities due to the varying stability of d-subshell configurations (e.g., \(d^0, d^5, d^{10}\)). The third ionisation enthalpy is very high for elements where it would involve removing an electron from a stable \(d^5\) (e.g., \(Mn^{2+}\)) or \(d^{10}\) (e.g., \(Zn^{2+}\)) configuration.</p>

        <h4 id="oxidation-states-d">Oxidation States</h4>
        <p>A hallmark of transition metals is their ability to exhibit a wide variety of oxidation states. This is because the energy difference between the (n-1)d and ns orbitals is small, allowing both sets of electrons to participate in bonding.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lowest common oxidation state is typically +2 (from losing the two ns electrons).</li>
            <li>The maximum oxidation state generally corresponds to the sum of the ns and (n-1)d electrons, peaking in the middle of the series. Manganese (Mn), for example, shows oxidation states from +2 to +7.</li>
            <li>In the p-block, lower oxidation states are favored by heavier elements (inert pair effect). The opposite is true for d-block elements, where higher oxidation states are often more stable for heavier elements in a group (e.g., W(VI) is more stable than Cr(VI)).</li>
            <li>Low oxidation states (like 0 or +1) are stabilized in complexes with \(\pi\)-acceptor ligands, such as CO in \(\ce{Ni(CO)4}\).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="electrode-potentials-d">Trends in Standard Electrode Potentials</h4>
        <p>The standard electrode potentials (\(E^\circ\)) for \(M^{2+}/M\) generally become less negative across a series, indicating a decreasing tendency to form divalent cations. However, there are irregularities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The \(E^\circ\) values for Mn, Ni, and Zn are more negative than expected. This is linked to the extra stability of the \(d^5\) configuration in \(Mn^{2+}\) and the \(d^{10}\) configuration in \(Zn^{2+}\).</li>
            <li>Copper (Cu) has a unique positive \(E^\circ\) value (+0.34 V). This explains why copper does not liberate \(\ce{H2}\) from acids. The high energy required to transform \(\ce{Cu(s)}\) to \(\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq)}\) (sum of atomisation and ionisation enthalpies) is not balanced by its hydration enthalpy.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="question-block">
            <h5>Question: Why is \(Cr^{2+}\) reducing and \(Mn^{3+}\) oxidising when both have a \(d^4\) configuration?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <p>\(Cr^{2+}\) is reducing because by losing an electron, it changes from \(d^4\) to \(d^3\). The \(d^3\) configuration has a half-filled \(t_{2g}\) level in an octahedral field, which provides extra stability. Therefore, \(Cr^{2+}\) readily oxidizes to \(Cr^{3+}\).</p>
            <p>\(Mn^{3+}\) is oxidizing because by gaining an electron, it changes from \(d^4\) to \(d^5\). The \(d^5\) configuration is a very stable half-filled d-subshell. Therefore, \(Mn^{3+}\) readily reduces to \(Mn^{2+}\).</p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="magnetic-properties-d">Magnetic Properties</h4>
        <p>Most transition metals and their compounds are <strong>paramagnetic</strong>. Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons. Substances with all paired electrons are <strong>diamagnetic</strong> and are repelled by a magnetic field. Ferromagnetism (e.g., in Fe, Co, Ni) is an extreme form of paramagnetism.</p>
        <p>The magnetic moment for first-row transition metals can be calculated using the 'spin-only' formula:</p>
        <p>$$ \mu = \sqrt{n(n+2)} \text{ BM (Bohr Magnetons)} $$</p>
        <p>where \(n\) is the number of unpaired electrons.</p>

        <h4 id="colored-ions-d">Formation of Coloured Ions</h4>
        <p>Most transition metal compounds are coloured in the solid state or in solution. The colour arises from the absorption of radiation from the visible light region to promote an electron from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital. This is known as a <strong>d-d transition</strong>. The colour of the compound is the complementary colour of the light absorbed. Since the energy of the d-d transition depends on the metal, its oxidation state, and the surrounding ligands, the colours vary widely. Ions with \(d^0\) (e.g., \(Sc^{3+}\)) or \(d^{10}\) (e.g., \(Zn^{2+}\), \(Cu^{+}\)) configurations are colourless.</p>

        <h4 id="complex-formation-d">Formation of Complex Compounds</h4>
        <p>Transition metals form a large number of coordination compounds or complexes. This is due to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The comparatively smaller size of their ions.</li>
            <li>Their high ionic charges.</li>
            <li>The availability of d orbitals for bond formation with ligands.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="catalytic-properties-d">Catalytic Properties</h4>
        <p>Transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This is attributed to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states, allowing them to form intermediates in a reaction.</li>
            <li>Their ability to provide a suitable surface for the reaction to occur, adsorbing reactants and weakening their bonds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Examples include V₂O₅ in the Contact process, Fe in the Haber-Bosch process, and Ni in catalytic hydrogenation.</p>

        <h4 id="interstitial-compounds-d">Formation of Interstitial Compounds</h4>
        <p>Transition metals can trap small atoms like H, C, or N in the interstitial voids in their crystal lattice to form interstitial compounds. These compounds are typically non-stoichiometric, very hard, have high melting points, retain metallic conductivity, and are chemically inert.</p>

        <h3 id="important-compounds-d">Important Compounds of Transition Elements</h3>
        <h4 id="k2cr2o7">Potassium Dichromate (\(\ce{K2Cr2O7}\))</h4>
        <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Potassium dichromate is prepared from chromite ore (\(\ce{FeCr2O4}\)).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The ore is fused with sodium carbonate in the presence of air to form sodium chromate.
            \[ \ce{4FeCr2O4 + 8Na2CO3 + 7O2 -> 8Na2CrO4 + 2Fe2O3 + 8CO2} \]</li>
            <li>The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulfuric acid to form orange sodium dichromate.
            \[ \ce{2Na2CrO4 + 2H+ -> Na2Cr2O7 + 2Na+ + H2O} \]</li>
            <li>A solution of sodium dichromate is treated with KCl to precipitate the less soluble potassium dichromate.
            \[ \ce{Na2Cr2O7 + 2KCl -> K2Cr2O7 + 2NaCl} \]</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Properties:</strong> In aqueous solution, there is an equilibrium between yellow chromate ions (\(\ce{CrO4^{2-}}\)) and orange dichromate ions (\(\ce{Cr2O7^{2-}}\)), which is pH-dependent. In acidic solution, dichromate is favored, while in basic solution, chromate is favored.</p>
        <div class="structure-diagram">
        \(\ce{2CrO4^{2-}(aq) + 2H+(aq) <=> Cr2O7^{2-}(aq) + H2O(l)}\)<br>

        </div>
        <p>Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent in acidic solution (\(E^\circ = +1.33\) V). It oxidizes iodides to iodine, iron(II) to iron(III), and sulfides to sulfur.
        \[ \ce{Cr2O7^{2-} + 14H+ + 6e- -> 2Cr^{3+} + 7H2O} \]
        </p>

        <h4 id="kmno4">Potassium Permanganate (\(\ce{KMnO4}\))</h4>
        <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> It is prepared from pyrolusite ore (\(\ce{MnO2}\)).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The ore is fused with an alkali metal hydroxide (like KOH) and an oxidizing agent (like \(\ce{KNO3}\)) to produce dark green potassium manganate (\(\ce{K2MnO4}\)).
            \[ \ce{2MnO2 + 4KOH + O2 -> 2K2MnO4 + 2H2O} \]</li>
            <li>The potassium manganate is then oxidized to potassium permanganate, either by disproportionation in a neutral/acidic medium or by electrolytic oxidation.
            \[ \ce{3MnO4^{2-} + 4H+ -> 2MnO4- + MnO2 + 2H2O} \]</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Properties:</strong> Potassium permanganate is a very strong oxidizing agent. Its action depends on the pH of the medium.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In acidic solution (\(E^\circ = +1.51\) V):</strong>
            \[ \ce{MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- -> Mn^{2+} + 4H2O} \]
            It oxidizes Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺, oxalate to CO₂, and I⁻ to I₂.
            </li>
            <li><strong>In neutral or faintly alkaline solution:</strong>
            \[ \ce{MnO4- + 2H2O + 3e- -> MnO2(s) + 4OH-} \]
            It oxidizes I⁻ to iodate (\(\ce{IO3-}\)) and thiosulfate to sulfate.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="f-block-intro">The Inner Transition Elements (f-Block)</h3>
        <p>The f-block consists of the lanthanoids and actinoids. They are characterized by the filling of the (n-2)f orbitals.</p>
        <h4 id="lanthanoids">The Lanthanoids</h4>
        <p>The 14 elements following lanthanum (La). The general electronic configuration is \([Xe] 4f^{1-14} 5d^{0-1} 6s^2\). The most stable oxidation state is <strong>+3</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lanthanoid Contraction:</strong> There is a steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii across the series. This is due to the poor shielding effect of 4f electrons.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Reactivity:</strong> The earlier members are quite reactive, similar to calcium, while later members behave more like aluminum. They react with water, acids, and halogens.</li>
            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> They are silvery-white, soft metals. Many of their trivalent ions are coloured and paramagnetic due to unpaired f electrons.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="actinoids">The Actinoids</h4>
        <p>The 14 elements following actinium (Ac). The general electronic configuration is \([Rn] 5f^{1-14} 6d^{0-1} 7s^2\).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Radioactivity:</strong> All actinoids are radioactive. The earlier members have relatively long half-lives, but the later members are extremely unstable.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxidation States:</strong> They show a much greater range of oxidation states than the lanthanoids (e.g., up to +7 for Np) because the 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals have comparable energies.</li>
            <li><strong>Actinoid Contraction:</strong> There is a contraction in size across the series, which is even more pronounced than the lanthanoid contraction due to the even poorer shielding by 5f electrons.</li>
            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> They are silvery metals, but are highly reactive, especially when finely divided. Their chemistry is more complex than that of the lanthanoids.</li>
        </ul>
