        <h3 id="intro_ch35">Biot-Savart Law</h3>
        <p>While the previous chapter defined the magnetic field based on the force it exerts, this chapter explores how currents create magnetic fields. The fundamental law describing the magnetic field produced by a current element is the <strong>Biot-Savart Law</strong>.</p>
        <p>The magnetic field $d\vec{B}$ produced by a small current element $i\,d\vec{l}$ at a point with position vector $\vec{r}$ relative to the element is given by:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i(d\vec{l} \times \vec{r})}{r^3} $$</div>
        <p>Here, $\mu_0$ is the <strong>permeability of free space</strong>, a fundamental constant with the value $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot\text{m/A}$. The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to both $d\vec{l}$ and $\vec{r}$, determined by the right-hand rule for cross products.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of the field is given by:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ dB = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i \, dl \sin\theta}{r^2} $$</div>
        <p>where $\theta$ is the angle between the current element $d\vec{l}$ and the position vector $\vec{r}$. The total magnetic field $\vec{B}$ at a point due to a wire is found by integrating $d\vec{B}$ over the entire length of the wire.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="field_straight_wire">Magnetic Field due to a Straight Wire</h3>
        <p>Using the Biot-Savart law, we can derive the magnetic field at a point P at a perpendicular distance $d$ from a straight wire of finite length.</p>
        <p>The magnetic field B is given by:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 i}{4\pi d} (\cos\theta_1 - \cos\theta_2) $$</div>
        <p>where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles subtended by the ends of the wire at point P.</p>
        <h4>Long Straight Wire</h4>
        <p>For a very long (or infinite) straight wire, $\theta_1 \to 0$ and $\theta_2 \to \pi$. The formula simplifies to:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 i}{2\pi d} $$</div>
        <p>The magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire. The direction of the field can be found using the <strong>right-hand thumb rule</strong>: if you point your right thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="force_parallel_wires">Force Between Parallel Currents</h3>
        <p>Two parallel current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other. A wire carrying current $i_1$ creates a magnetic field, which then exerts a force on a second wire carrying current $i_2$.</p>
        <p>The force per unit length between two long, parallel wires separated by a distance $d$ is:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ \frac{F}{l} = \frac{\mu_0 i_1 i_2}{2\pi d} $$</div>
        <ul>
            <li>If the currents are in the <strong>same direction</strong>, the wires <strong>attract</strong> each other.</li>
            <li>If the currents are in <strong>opposite directions</strong>, the wires <strong>repel</strong> each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This relationship is used to define the <strong>Ampere (A)</strong>, the SI unit of current. One Ampere is the constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to $2 \times 10^{-7}$ newton per metre of length.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="field_circular_loop">Magnetic Field due to a Circular Current Loop</h3>
        <h4>Field at the Center</h4>
        <p>For a circular loop of radius $a$ carrying a current $i$, the magnetic field at its center is uniform and directed perpendicular to the plane of the loop. Its magnitude is:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ B_{center} = \frac{\mu_0 i}{2a} $$</div>
        <h4>Field on the Axis</h4>
        <p>At a point on the axis of the circular loop at a distance $d$ from its center, the magnetic field is directed along the axis and has a magnitude:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ B_{axis} = \frac{\mu_0 i a^2}{2(a^2 + d^2)^{3/2}} $$</div>
        <p>At the center, $d=0$, which recovers the previous formula. For points far from the loop ($d \gg a$), this approximates the field of a magnetic dipole.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="amperes_law">Ampere's Law</h3>
        <p>Ampere's Circuital Law provides a powerful alternative to the Biot-Savart law for calculating magnetic fields, especially in situations with high symmetry.</p>
        <p>The law states that the line integral of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ around any closed loop (called an Amperian loop) is proportional to the total current $i_{enc}$ passing through the area enclosed by the loop:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 i_{enc} $$</div>
        <p>This law is analogous to Gauss's law in electrostatics and is one of Maxwell's four equations.</p>
        <h4>Applications of Ampere's Law:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long Straight Wire:</strong> Applying Ampere's law to a circular loop of radius $d$ around the wire gives $B(2\pi d) = \mu_0 i$, which leads to $B = \frac{\mu_0 i}{2\pi d}$.</li>
            <li><strong>Solenoid:</strong> A solenoid is a coil of wire wound into a tight helix. For a long solenoid with $n$ turns per unit length carrying current $i$, the magnetic field inside is uniform and strong, while the field outside is nearly zero. The field inside is:
                <div class="math-eq">$$ B = \mu_0 n i $$</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Toroid:</strong> A toroid is a solenoid bent into a donut shape. The magnetic field is confined within the toroidal core and is given by:
                <div class="math-eq">$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 N i}{2\pi r} $$</div>
                where $N$ is the total number of turns and $r$ is the distance from the center.

        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>The current element $d\vec{l}$ is $1 \text{ cm} = 10^{-2} \text{ m}$ along the north direction. The point P is at a distance $r = 200 \text{ cm} = 2 \text{ m}$ in the north-east direction. The angle $\theta$ between $d\vec{l}$ (north) and $\vec{r}$ (north-east) is $45^\circ$.</p>
            <p>Using the Biot-Savart law in magnitude form:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ dB = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i \, dl \sin\theta}{r^2} $$</div>

            <div class="math-eq">$$ dB = \frac{10^{-8} \times (1/\sqrt{2})}{4} \text{ T} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-9} \text{ T} $$</div>

            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>Let the currents be $i_1$ and $i_2$, both equal to 10 A. The point P is midway, so the distance from each wire is $d = 2.5 \text{ cm} = 0.025 \text{ m}$.</p>
            <p>Using the right-hand thumb rule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The top wire's current (let's say, to the right) creates a magnetic field $B_1$ at P that is directed into the page.</li>
                <li>The bottom wire's current (to the left) creates a magnetic field $B_2$ at P that is also directed into the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The net magnetic field is the sum of the magnitudes of $B_1$ and $B_2$.</p>
            <p>The magnitude of the field from each wire is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ B_1 = B_2 = \frac{\mu_0 i}{2\pi d} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot\text{m/A})(10 \text{ A})}{2\pi(0.025 \text{ m})} = 8.0 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T} = 80 \, \mu\text{T} $$</div>
            <p>The total magnetic field at P is:</p>

            <h5>Question</h5>
            <p>A current of 10 A is established in a long wire along the positive z-axis. Find the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ at the point (1 m, 0, 0).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>The wire is along the z-axis. The point (1 m, 0, 0) is on the x-axis. The perpendicular distance $d$ from the wire to the point is 1 m.</p>
            <p>The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a long straight wire is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 i}{2\pi d} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot\text{m/A})(10 \text{ A})}{2\pi(1 \text{ m})} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T} $$</div>
            <p>For the direction, we use the right-hand thumb rule. If the current is along the +z direction, the magnetic field at a point on the +x axis will be in the <strong>+y direction</strong>.</p>
