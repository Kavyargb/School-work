        <h3 id="intro_ch2">Introduction to Potential Energy</h3>
        <p>In mechanics (Class XI), potential energy is defined as the work done by an external force to move a body against a conservative force (like spring or gravitational force). This work gets stored as potential energy.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Coulomb force</strong> between two stationary charges is also a <u>conservative force</u>. Therefore, we can define electrostatic potential energy for charges in an electrostatic field.</p>
        <p>When an external force $F_{ext}$ moves a charge $q$ from point R to point P against an electric force $F_E$ (such that $F_{ext} = -F_E$), the work done by the external force is stored as potential energy:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ W_{RP} = \int_R^P \vec{F}_{ext} \cdot d\vec{r} = - \int_R^P \vec{F}_E \cdot d\vec{r} $$</div>
        <p>This work done equals the change in potential energy:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ \Delta U = U_P - U_R = W_{RP} $$</div>
        <p>Two key remarks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The work done by an electrostatic field depends <u>only on the initial and final positions</u>, not on the path taken. This is the fundamental characteristic of a conservative force.</li>
            <li>Potential energy is defined up to an additive constant. By convention, electrostatic potential energy is often taken as zero at <strong>infinity</strong>. With this choice, the potential energy of a charge $q$ at a point P is the work done by an external force in bringing the charge $q$ from infinity to that point P ($U_P = W_{\infty P}$).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="electrostatic_potential">Electrostatic Potential</h3>
        <p>Electrostatic potential (V) at a point in an electric field is defined as the <u>work done by an external force in bringing a unit positive test charge from infinity to that point</u>, without acceleration.</p>
        <p>It is the potential energy per unit charge:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V_P - V_R = \frac{U_P - U_R}{q} = \frac{W_{RP}}{q} $$</div>
        <p>If we choose $V_R = 0$ at infinity, then the electrostatic potential at point P is:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V_P = \frac{W_{\infty P}}{q} $$</div>
        <p>The SI unit of electrostatic potential is <strong>Joule per Coulomb (J/C)</strong>, which is called a <strong>Volt (V)</strong>.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="potential_point_charge">Potential Due to a Point Charge</h3>
        <p>The electrostatic potential $V(r)$ due to a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ from it is given by:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r} $$</div>
        <ul>
            <li>For a positive charge $Q > 0$, the potential is positive and decreases as $r$ increases.</li>
            <li>For a negative charge $Q < 0$, the potential is negative and becomes less negative (increases) as $r$ increases.</li>
            <li>This equation is consistent with $V=0$ at infinity.</li>
            <li>Comparison with electric field: Electric field due to a point charge falls off as $1/r^2$, while electric potential falls off as $1/r$.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="potential_dipole">Potential Due to an Electric Dipole</h3>
        <p>An electric dipole consists of two charges $+q$ and $-q$ separated by a distance $2a$. Its dipole moment is $\vec{p} = q(2\vec{a})$, pointing from $-q$ to $+q$.</p>
        <p>The electric potential at a point with position vector $\vec{r}$ (from the centre of the dipole) and making an angle $\theta$ with the dipole moment $\vec{p}$ is:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \vec{r}}{r^3} $$</div>
        <p>For a point P at a large distance $r \gg a$ from the dipole, the potential simplifies to:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{p \cos\theta}{r^2} $$</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On the axial line ($\theta = 0^\circ$ or $\theta = 180^\circ$):</strong> $V = \pm \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{p}{r^2}$. Positive along $\vec{p}$, negative opposite to $\vec{p}$.</li>
            <li><strong>On the equatorial plane ($\theta = 90^\circ$):</strong> $V = 0$.</li>
            <li>The potential due to a dipole depends not just on distance $r$ but also on angle $\theta$.</li>
            <li>The potential due to a dipole falls off as $1/r^2$, which is faster than the $1/r$ dependence for a single point charge.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="potential_system">Potential Due to a System of Charges</h3>
        <p>By the superposition principle, the total electrostatic potential at any point P due to a system of $n$ point charges ($q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n$) is the algebraic sum of the potentials due to individual charges:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V(\vec{r}) = V_1(\vec{r}) + V_2(\vec{r}) + \dots + V_n(\vec{r}) $$</div>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1}{r_1} + \frac{q_2}{r_2} + \dots + \frac{q_n}{r_n} \right) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{q_i}{r_i} $$</div>
        <p>where $r_i$ is the distance of point P from the charge $q_i$.</p>
        <h4>Potential due to a Uniformly Charged Spherical Shell</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Outside the shell ($r \ge R$):</strong> The potential is the same as if the entire charge $q$ were concentrated at the centre.
                <div class="math-eq">$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} $$</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inside the shell ($r < R$):</strong> The electric field inside is zero. This implies no work is done moving a charge inside, so the potential is constant and equal to its value at the surface.
                <div class="math-eq">$$ V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{R} $$</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="equipotential">Equipotential Surfaces</h3>
        <p>An <strong>equipotential surface</strong> is a surface on which the electrostatic potential is constant at all points.</p>
        <h4>Properties:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>No work done:</strong> No work is required to move a test charge from one point to another on an equipotential surface, since $W = q(V_P - V_R)$ and $V_P = V_R$.</li>
            <li><strong>Electric field is perpendicular:</strong> The electric field $\vec{E}$ at any point on an equipotential surface is always perpendicular (normal) to the surface at that point. If it were not, there would be a component of $\vec{E}$ along the surface, and work would be done in moving a charge, which contradicts the definition.</li>
            <li><strong>Never intersect:</strong> Two equipotential surfaces can never intersect each other, as this would imply two different potentials at the same point, which is impossible.</li>
            <li><strong>Density of lines:</strong> Equipotential surfaces are closer together in regions of strong electric field and farther apart in regions of weak electric field.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For a <strong>single point charge</strong>, equipotential surfaces are concentric spheres centered at the charge.</li>
            <li>For a <strong>uniform electric field</strong>, equipotential surfaces are a set of parallel planes perpendicular to the field lines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="relation_ev">Relation between Electric Field and Potential</h3>
        <p>The electric field $\vec{E}$ and potential $V$ are related by:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ E = - \frac{dV}{dl} $$</div>
        <p>where $dV$ is the change in potential over a small displacement $dl$ along the direction of $\vec{E}$.</p>
        <p>This relation implies two key points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases most rapidly (steepest).</li>
            <li>The magnitude of the electric field is equal to the potential gradient (rate of change of potential with distance) in that direction.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="pe_system_external">Potential Energy of a System of Charges in an External Field</h3>
        <h4>1. Potential Energy of a Single Charge in an External Field</h4>
        <p>If a charge $q$ is placed at a point $\vec{r}$ in an external electric potential $V(\vec{r})$, its potential energy is:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ U(\vec{r}) = qV(\vec{r}) $$</div>
        <p>This is the work done by an external agency to bring the charge $q$ from infinity to point $\vec{r}$ against the external electric field.</p>
        <p>The unit of energy frequently used in atomic and nuclear physics is the <strong>electron volt (eV)</strong>:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ 1 \text{ eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} $$</div>
        
        <h4>2. Potential Energy of a System of Two Charges in an External Field</h4>
        <p>For two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ located at $\vec{r}_1$ and $\vec{r}_2$ in an external potential $V(\vec{r})$, the total potential energy is the sum of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Potential energy of $q_1$ in the external field: $q_1 V(\vec{r}_1)$.</li>
            <li>Potential energy of $q_2$ in the external field: $q_2 V(\vec{r}_2)$.</li>
            <li>Potential energy due to interaction between $q_1$ and $q_2$: $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}}$, where $r_{12}$ is the distance between $q_1$ and $q_2$.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, the total potential energy is:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ U = q_1 V(\vec{r}_1) + q_2 V(\vec{r}_2) + \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}} $$</div>
        
        <h4>3. Potential Energy of a Dipole in a Uniform External Electric Field</h4>
        <p>When an electric dipole with dipole moment $\vec{p}$ is placed in a uniform external electric field $\vec{E}$, it experiences a torque $\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$ that tends to align it with the field. The potential energy $U$ of the dipole in the field depends on its orientation $\theta$ with respect to the field:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} = -pE \cos\theta $$</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum energy (stable equilibrium) when $\theta = 0^\circ$ (dipole aligned with field). $U_{min} = -pE$.</li>
            <li>Maximum energy (unstable equilibrium) when $\theta = 180^\circ$ (dipole anti-parallel to field). $U_{max} = +pE$.</li>
            <li>Potential energy is zero when $\theta = 90^\circ$ (perpendicular to field), by convention.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="conductors">Electrostatics of Conductors</h3>
        <p>Conductors are materials that contain mobile charge carriers (e.g., free electrons in metals). Key properties in electrostatics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero:</strong> In a static situation, free charges distribute themselves such that the net electric field everywhere inside the conductor is zero.</li>
            <li><strong>At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field is normal to the surface:</strong> If there were a tangential component, free charges would move along the surface, creating a current, which contradicts the static condition.</li>
            <li><strong>The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in the static situation:</strong> Any net charge given to a conductor resides on its outer surface. This follows from Gauss's Law ($E=0$ inside means $q_{enc}=0$).</li>
            <li><strong>Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value on its surface:</strong> Since $E=0$ inside, no work is done in moving a charge within the conductor, implying zero potential difference.</li>
            <li><strong>Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor:</strong> The magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ just outside the surface of a charged conductor is directly proportional to the surface charge density $\sigma$:
                <div class="math-eq">$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \hat{n} $$</div>
                where $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to the surface in the outward direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Electrostatic Shielding:</strong> The electric field inside a cavity within a conductor (with no charges placed inside the cavity) is zero, regardless of the external fields or charges on the conductor. This phenomenon is used to protect sensitive instruments from external electric influences.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="dielectrics">Dielectrics and Polarisation</h3>
        <p><strong>Dielectrics</strong> are non-conducting substances (insulators) that have no free charge carriers.</p>
        <p>When a dielectric is placed in an external electric field $\vec{E}_0$, the field induces dipole moments within the material, a process called <strong>polarisation</strong>. Unlike conductors, dielectrics do not allow charges to move freely to cancel the external field completely; instead, they reduce the net electric field inside them.</p>
        <h4>Types of Molecules:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-polar molecules:</strong> Molecules in which the centres of positive and negative charges coincide (e.g., O₂, H₂). In an external field, an induced dipole moment is created as the charges are displaced in opposite directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Polar molecules:</strong> Molecules in which the centres of positive and negative charges do not coincide, even in the absence of an external field (e.g., H₂O, HCl). They possess a permanent dipole moment. In an external field, these dipoles tend to align with the field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, a net dipole moment is developed in the dielectric. The dipole moment per unit volume is called <strong>Polarisation ($\vec{P}$)</strong>.</p>
        <p>For linear isotropic dielectrics, $\vec{P}$ is proportional to $\vec{E}$:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ \vec{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E} $$</div>
        <p>where $\chi_e$ (chi-e) is the <strong>electric susceptibility</strong> of the dielectric medium.</p>
        <p>The collective effect of these induced dipoles or aligned permanent dipoles is the appearance of <u>induced surface charges ($\sigma_p$)</u> on the faces of the dielectric. These induced charges create an electric field ($\vec{E}_p$) inside the dielectric that opposes the external field $\vec{E}_0$.</p>
        <p>The net electric field inside the dielectric is reduced:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ \vec{E} = \vec{E}_0 - \vec{E}_p $$</div>
        <p>The extent of this reduction depends on the nature of the dielectric.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="capacitors">Capacitors and Capacitance</h3>
        <p>A <strong>capacitor</strong> is a system of two conductors separated by an insulating medium (dielectric). When charged, the conductors have equal and opposite charges, say $+Q$ and $-Q$, and a potential difference $V$ between them.</p>
        <p>The <strong>capacitance (C)</strong> of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the charge on either conductor to the potential difference between them:</p>
        <div class="math-eq">$$ C = \frac{Q}{V} $$</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Capacitance is a measure of a capacitor's ability to store electric charge.</li>
            <li>It depends on the <u>geometrical configuration</u> (shape, size, separation) of the conductors and the <u>nature of the dielectric medium</u> between them. It does NOT depend on $Q$ or $V$.</li>
            <li>The SI unit of capacitance is the <strong>Farad (F)</strong>. $1 \text{ F} = 1 \text{ C/V}$.</li>
            <li>Commonly used smaller units are microfarad ($\mu$F = 10⁻⁶ F), nanofarad (nF = 10⁻⁹ F), and picofarad (pF = 10⁻¹² F). A Farad is a very large unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Dielectric Strength:</strong> The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand without breakdown (losing its insulating property) is called its dielectric strength.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="parallel_plate_capacitor">The Parallel Plate Capacitor</h3>
        <p>A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting plates of area $A$ separated by a small distance $d$.</p>
        <p>If there is <strong>vacuum (or air)</strong> between the plates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The surface charge densities are $\sigma = Q/A$ and $-\sigma = -Q/A$.</li>
            <li>The electric field between the plates is uniform and given by:
                <div class="math-eq">$$ E_0 = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A} $$</div>
            </li>
            <li>The potential difference between the plates is $V_0 = E_0 d = \frac{Qd}{\epsilon_0 A}$.</li>
            <li>The capacitance ($C_0$) is:
                <div class="math-eq">$$ C_0 = \frac{Q}{V_0} = \frac{Q}{Qd/(\epsilon_0 A)} = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} $$</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="dielectric_effect">Effect of Dielectric on Capacitance</h3>
        <p>When a dielectric medium is inserted between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor (fully occupying the space):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The external field $\vec{E}_0$ polarizes the dielectric, creating an opposing field $\vec{E}_p$ due to induced surface charges.</li>
            <li>The net electric field inside the dielectric is reduced to $E = E_0/K$, where $K$ is the <strong>dielectric constant</strong> (or relative permittivity) of the medium.
                <div class="math-eq">$$ E = \frac{\sigma - \sigma_p}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{E_0}{K} $$</div>
            </li>
            <li>The potential difference across the plates is reduced to $V = E d = \frac{V_0}{K}$.</li>
            <li>The capacitance $C$ with the dielectric is:
                <div class="math-eq">$$ C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{Q}{V_0/K} = K \frac{Q}{V_0} = KC_0 $$</div>
            </li>
            <li>The dielectric constant $K$ is defined as the ratio of the capacitance with dielectric ($C$) to the capacitance with vacuum ($C_0$):
                <div class="math-eq">$$ K = \frac{C}{C_0} = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} $$</div>
                where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the medium. $K \ge 1$.</li>
            <li>Thus, inserting a dielectric increases the capacitance by a factor of $K$. For a parallel plate capacitor, $C = \frac{K\epsilon_0 A}{d} = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}$.</li>

        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>Let $q_1 = 3 \times 10^{-8}$ C and $q_2 = -2 \times 10^{-8}$ C. The distance between them is $d = 15 \text{ cm} = 0.15 \text{ m}$.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>(a) <strong>$V_P - V_Q$:</strong> For a positive charge (Fig 2.8a), potential decreases as distance increases. Since Q is closer to the positive charge than P, $V_Q > V_P$. Therefore, $V_P - V_Q$ is <strong>negative</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>$V_B - V_A$:</strong> For a negative charge (Fig 2.8b), potential increases as distance increases (becomes less negative). Since B is closer to the negative charge than A, $V_B < V_A$ (e.g., $V_B = -10\text{V}$, $V_A = -5\text{V}$). Therefore, $V_B - V_A$ is <strong>negative</strong>.</p>

            <p>(b) Potential energy difference is $\Delta U = q \Delta V$. If $q$ is a small negative charge, $q < 0$.</p>
            <p><strong>Q to P (for positive charge):</strong> $\Delta U = q (V_P - V_Q)$. Since $q < 0$ and $(V_P - V_Q) < 0$ (from (a)), $\Delta U$ is <strong>positive</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>A to B (for negative charge):</strong> $\Delta U = q (V_B - V_A)$. Since $q < 0$ and $(V_B - V_A) < 0$ (from (a)), $\Delta U$ is <strong>positive</strong>.</p>

            <p>(c) Work done by the electric field $W_E = - \Delta U = -q\Delta V$. For a small positive charge ($q > 0$) moved from Q to P ($V_P - V_Q < 0$):</p>
            <p>$W_E = -(q(V_P - V_Q))$. Since $q>0$ and $(V_P - V_Q)<0$, the term $(V_P - V_Q)$ is negative, so $W_E$ is <strong>positive</strong>.</p>
            <p><em>(Note: NCERT states "work has to be done by an external agency against the electric field. Therefore, work done by the field is negative." This implies moving *from lower potential to higher potential*. For Q to P in Fig 2.8a (positive charge), Q is at higher potential and P at lower. So, the field *does* positive work in moving a positive charge from higher potential to lower potential, i.e., along the field lines. $W_E = V_{initial} - V_{final} = V_Q - V_P > 0$. The NCERT solution appears to have a different interpretation of Q to P or the sign conventions.)</em></p>

            <p>(d) Work done by external agency $W_{ext} = \Delta U = q\Delta V$. For a small negative charge ($q < 0$) moved from B to A ($V_B - V_A < 0$):</p>
            <p>$W_{ext} = q(V_A - V_B)$. Since $q < 0$ and $V_A - V_B > 0$ (as $V_B < V_A$), $W_{ext}$ is <strong>negative</strong>. The NCERT solution says "positive", which suggests they are talking about moving *from A to B* or the magnitude of work needed. If moving *against* the field from B to A for a negative charge, an external force would have to push it towards the negative charge (since it would naturally repel). B is closer to negative charge, so $V_B$ is more negative. A is farther, $V_A$ is less negative. Thus, moving from B to A for a negative charge is moving from lower potential to higher potential (less negative potential is higher). External work is positive when moving from lower to higher potential.</p>
            <p>Let's re-evaluate d) based on standard interpretation:
            For a negative charge to move from B to A, it is moving from a lower potential ($V_B$) to a higher potential ($V_A$). Work done by external force $W_{ext} = q(V_A - V_B)$. Since $q$ is negative and $(V_A - V_B)$ is positive, $W_{ext}$ is <strong>negative</strong>. The NCERT answer might be considering absolute value or a different scenario. Assuming standard physics convention, it's negative.</p>

            <p>(e) A small negative charge moving from B to A (in the field of a negative charge) is moving towards a region of less negative potential (higher potential). The electric force on a negative charge is opposite to the direction of $\vec{E}$. $\vec{E}$ points towards the negative charge. So the force on the negative test charge is radially outwards, i.e., from B towards A. This force is doing positive work on the charge. If only electric force acts, its kinetic energy would increase. However, the problem asks about "going from B to A" implying work done by external agency. If it's brought *without acceleration*, then $\Delta K = -\Delta U$. Since $\Delta U$ is positive (from b)), $\Delta K$ is <strong>negative</strong>. So, kinetic energy decreases.</p>
            <p>NCERT's answer: "Due to force of repulsion on the negative charge, velocity decreases and hence the kinetic energy decreases in going from B to A." This implies that the electric force would *slow down* the charge if it were moving from B to A. Wait, that contradicts previous parts. Let's re-read (b) for "A to B". For (b), for negative charge moving from A to B: $\Delta U = q(V_B-V_A)$. $q<0$, $V_B-V_A<0 \implies \Delta U > 0$. So, P.E. increases from A to B. This means the electric field does negative work.
            Now for (e) B to A: Moving from $V_B$ to $V_A$. $V_A-V_B$ is positive. For a negative charge, $q(V_A-V_B)$ is negative. So P.E. decreases. If P.E. decreases, K.E. increases.
            The NCERT solution for (e) is contradictory to standard energy conservation and the signs established in (a) and (b). If P.E. decreases (B to A for negative charge), K.E. must increase. Let's assume the standard physics principle holds: if a particle moves from higher potential energy to lower potential energy, its kinetic energy increases. Here, from (b), $U_B > U_A$ (for a negative charge). Thus, moving from B to A, P.E. decreases, so K.E. must <strong>increase</strong>.</p>

            <p><em>(NCERT also provides an additional part (c) for this example: "Suppose that the same system of charges is now placed in an external electric field $E = A(1/r^2)$; $A = 9 \times 10^5 \text{ NC}^{-1} \text{ m}^2$. What would the electrostatic energy of the configuration be?"
            This involves potential energy in an external field.
            $U_{ext} = q_1 V(\vec{r}_1) + q_2 V(\vec{r}_2) + U_{mutual}$.
            Here $V(r) = \int E \cdot dr = \int A/r^2 dr = -A/r$.
            $V(r_1) = V(9\text{ cm}) = -A/(0.09) = -9 \times 10^5 / 0.09 = -10^7 \text{ V}$.
            $V(r_2) = V(9\text{ cm}) = -A/(0.09) = -10^7 \text{ V}$.
            So, $U_{ext} = (7 \times 10^{-6})(-10^7) + (-2 \times 10^{-6})(-10^7) + (-0.7)$
            $= -70 + 20 - 0.7 = -50.7 \text{ J}$.
            The NCERT solution for (c) has a potential that varies with $r$. For a charge at (-9cm,0,0) and (9cm,0,0), it gives:
            $q_1V(r_1) + q_2V(r_2) = A \frac{7\mu C}{0.09m} + A \frac{-2\mu C}{0.09m} = A \frac{5\mu C}{0.09m} = 9 \times 10^5 \times \frac{5 \times 10^{-6}}{0.09} = 50 \text{ J}$.
            This is consistent if the potential function is defined as $V(r) = A/r$ not $-A/r$. In the NCERT book it says $E=A(1/r^2)$ and then calculates $qV(r)$ and $q_2V(r_2)$. For $E = A/r^2$, the potential $V(r)$ would be $-A/r$ typically. If it's $A/r$, then $E = -dV/dr = A/r^2$. So $V(r) = A/r$ is fine.
            $q_1V(r_1) = 7\mu C \times \frac{9 \times 10^5}{0.09} = 7\mu C \times 10^7 = 70 \text{ J}$.
            $q_2V(r_2) = -2\mu C \times \frac{9 \times 10^5}{0.09} = -2\mu C \times 10^7 = -20 \text{ J}$.
            Summing: $70 - 20 - 0.7 = 49.3 \text{ J}$. This matches NCERT. So $V(r) = A/r$ was assumed.)</em></p>

            <h5>Question</h5>
            <p>A molecule of a substance has a permanent electric dipole moment of magnitude $10^{-29}$ C m. A mole of this substance is polarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field of magnitude $10^6$ V m⁻¹. The direction of the field is suddenly changed by an angle of 60°. Estimate the heat released by the substance in aligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity, assume 100% polarisation of the sample.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>The potential energy of a dipole in an external electric field is $U = -pE \cos\theta$.</p>
            <p>Given:
            <ul>
                <li>Dipole moment of one molecule, $p_{mol} = 10^{-29}$ C m.</li>
                <li>Electric field, $E = 10^6$ V m⁻¹.</li>
                <li>Avogadro's number $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules/mol.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>First, calculate the total dipole moment of 1 mole of the substance:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ P_{total} = N_A \times p_{mol} = (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \times (10^{-29}) = 6.022 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C m} $$</div>
            <p>Initial angle of alignment: The dipoles are initially aligned, so $\theta_1 = 0^\circ$.</p>
            <p>Initial potential energy:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_1 = -P_{total} E \cos(0^\circ) = -(6.022 \times 10^{-6})(10^6)(1) = -6.022 \text{ J} $$</div>
            <p>Final angle of alignment: The field direction changes by 60°, so $\theta_2 = 60^\circ$.</p>
            <p>Final potential energy:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_2 = -P_{total} E \cos(60^\circ) = -(6.022 \times 10^{-6})(10^6)(0.5) = -3.011 \text{ J} $$</div>
            <p>The change in potential energy is $\Delta U = U_2 - U_1$:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ \Delta U = (-3.011 \text{ J}) - (-6.022 \text{ J}) = 3.011 \text{ J} $$</div>
            <p>Since $\Delta U$ is positive, the potential energy of the system has increased. This means the substance has absorbed energy. However, the problem asks for heat *released*. If the dipoles are aligning themselves (moving from higher PE to lower PE), energy is released. Let's assume initial state is where dipoles are not fully aligned with the field, e.g., random initial state where $U_1=0$, and final state is $\theta=60^\circ$. The problem implies a re-alignment *from* an aligned state. Let's follow NCERT's interpretation.</p>
            <p>If the field was initially aligned, and then it rotates by $60^\circ$, the dipoles will *re-align* to the new field direction. This means they *end up* at $\theta_2 = 0^\circ$ relative to the *new* field direction, and *started* at $60^\circ$ relative to the new field direction (because they were aligned with the *old* field direction, which rotated by $60^\circ$).</p>
            <p>So, the initial angle (relative to the *new* field direction) is $\theta_1 = 60^\circ$.
            <br>The final angle (relative to the *new* field direction) is $\theta_2 = 0^\circ$.</p>
            <p>Initial potential energy (relative to new field):</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_1 = -P_{total} E \cos(60^\circ) = -(6.022 \times 10^{-6})(10^6)(0.5) = -3.011 \text{ J} $$</div>
            <p>Final potential energy (relative to new field):</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_2 = -P_{total} E \cos(0^\circ) = -(6.022 \times 10^{-6})(10^6)(1) = -6.022 \text{ J} $$</div>
            <p>Change in potential energy $\Delta U = U_2 - U_1 = (-6.022 \text{ J}) - (-3.011 \text{ J}) = -3.011 \text{ J}$.</p>
            <p>Since the change in potential energy is negative, the potential energy of the system has decreased. This energy is released as heat.
            <br>Heat released $= |\Delta U| \approx \mathbf{3.01 \text{ J}}$.</p>

            <h5>Question</h5>
            <p>(a) A comb run through one's dry hair attracts small bits of paper. What happens if the hair is wet or if it is a rainy day? (Remember, a paper does not conduct electricity.)<br>(b) Ordinary rubber is an insulator. But special rubber tyres of aircraft are made slightly conducting. Why is this necessary?<br>(c) Vehicles carrying inflammable materials usually have metallic ropes touching the ground during motion. Why?<br>(d) A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens to the bird. A man standing on the ground touches the same line and gets a fatal shock. Why?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>(a) When a comb is run through dry hair, it gets charged by friction (triboelectric effect). This charged comb then induces charges in the paper bits, leading to attraction. If the hair is wet or on a rainy day, the moisture in the air acts as a conductor, allowing charges to leak away quickly from the comb. Thus, the comb does not get sufficiently charged to attract paper bits.</p>
            <p>(b) When an aircraft lands or takes off, friction between its tyres and the runway causes the aircraft body to accumulate static electric charge. If the tyres were perfect insulators, this charge would build up to a very high potential, which could lead to sparks and damage to the aircraft or cause a fire. By making the tyres slightly conducting, the accumulated charge can slowly leak to the ground, preventing dangerous build-up.</p>
            <p>(c) Inflammable materials (like petrol, LPG) are highly combustible. As vehicles carrying these materials move, friction between the tyres and the road, or between the liquid and the tank walls, can build up static electric charge on the vehicle's body. A spark from this accumulated charge could ignite the inflammable material. Metallic ropes touching the ground provide a path for this static charge to be continuously conducted to the Earth, thus preventing dangerous charge accumulation and sparks.</p>
            <p>(d) A bird perching on a single high power line does not get a shock because its body (feet) is at the same high potential as the wire. There is no potential difference across its body, so no current flows through it. A man standing on the ground, however, is at ground (zero) potential. When he touches the high power line, a large potential difference exists between his hand (at line's potential) and his feet (at ground potential). This large potential difference causes a significant current to flow through his body to the ground, resulting in a fatal shock.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>Let the capacitance of the parallel-plate capacitor with vacuum be $C_0 = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$.
            <br>When the capacitor is connected to a battery, let the potential difference be $V_0$. The electric field in vacuum is $E_0 = V_0/d$.</p>
            <p>When the dielectric slab of thickness $t = (3/4)d$ and dielectric constant $K$ is inserted, there are now two regions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The region with dielectric: thickness $t = (3/4)d$. The electric field in this region is $E_d = E_0/K$.</li>
                <li>The vacuum region: thickness $d - t = d - (3/4)d = (1/4)d$. The electric field in this region is $E_v = E_0$.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The total potential difference $V$ across the plates is the sum of potential differences across these two regions:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ V = E_d t + E_v (d-t) $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ V = \frac{E_0}{K} \left(\frac{3}{4}d\right) + E_0 \left(\frac{1}{4}d\right) $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ V = E_0 d \left( \frac{3}{4K} + \frac{1}{4} \right) = V_0 \left( \frac{3 + K}{4K} \right) $$</div>
            <p>The new capacitance $C$ is $C = Q/V$. Since the charge $Q$ on the plates remains the same (assuming it's disconnected from battery or kept charged), $Q = C_0 V_0$.</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C = \frac{C_0 V_0}{V} = \frac{C_0 V_0}{V_0 \left( \frac{3+K}{4K} \right)} = C_0 \frac{4K}{3+K} $$</div>
            <p>The capacitance is changed by a factor of $\frac{4K}{3+K}$. Since $K \ge 1$, this factor is always greater than 1, so the capacitance increases.</p>

                <li>The charge on the plates will increase: $Q = CV = (106.2 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F}) \times (100 \text{ V}) = 1.062 \times 10^{-8} \text{ C}$. This additional charge will be drawn from the battery.</li>
                <li>The electric field between the plates will remain the same ($E = V/d$). It doesn't change because $V$ is kept constant and $d$ is constant.

                <li>The electric field between the plates will decrease: $E = V/d = (V_0/K)/d = E_0/K$. This is because the charge is fixed, and the induced field in the dielectric reduces the net field.</li>

            <h5>Question</h5>
            <p>A 600 pF capacitor is charged by a 200 V supply. It is then disconnected from the supply and is connected to another uncharged 600 pF capacitor. How much electrostatic energy is lost in the process?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>Given: $C_1 = 600 \text{ pF} = 600 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F}$.
            <br>Supply voltage $V_1 = 200 \text{ V}$.
            <br>Second capacitor $C_2 = 600 \text{ pF}$ (uncharged).</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Energy stored in $C_1$ before disconnection.</strong>
            <br>Charge on $C_1$: $Q_1 = C_1 V_1 = (600 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F}) \times (200 \text{ V}) = 1.2 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C}$.
            <br>Initial energy stored ($U_i$):</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_i = \frac{1}{2} C_1 V_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} (600 \times 10^{-12}) (200)^2 = 300 \times 10^{-12} \times 40000 = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ J} $$</div>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Energy stored after connecting to $C_2$.</strong>
            <br>When $C_1$ (charged) is disconnected and connected to $C_2$ (uncharged) in parallel, the total charge is conserved.
            <br>Total charge $Q_{total} = Q_1 + 0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ C.
            <br>Equivalent capacitance in parallel: $C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 = 600 \text{ pF} + 600 \text{ pF} = 1200 \text{ pF}$.
            <br>Common potential $V'$ after connection:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ V' = \frac{Q_{total}}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C}}{1200 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F}} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-7}}{1.2 \times 10^{-9}} = 100 \text{ V} $$</div>
            <p>Final energy stored ($U_f$) in the system:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_f = \frac{1}{2} C_{eq} (V')^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1200 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F}) (100 \text{ V})^2 $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ U_f = 600 \times 10^{-12} \times 10000 = 6 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J} $$</div>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Energy lost.</strong>
            <br>Energy lost $\Delta U = U_i - U_f$:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ \Delta U = (1.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ J}) - (6 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J}) = (12 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J}) - (6 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J}) = 6 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J} $$</div>
            <p>The electrostatic energy lost in the process is <strong>$6 \times 10^{-6}$ J</strong>. This energy is dissipated primarily as heat in the connecting wires during charge redistribution.</p>

        <div class="answer-block">
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>We use the formula for a parallel-plate capacitor, $C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$, and solve for the radius $r$, where $A = \pi r^2$.</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C = \frac{\epsilon_0 (\pi r^2)}{d} \implies r^2 = \frac{C d}{\epsilon_0 \pi} $$</div>

            </ul>
            <p>Now, calculate the radius squared:</p>

            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>First, we simplify the capacitor network to find the total equivalent capacitance.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1: Combine parallel capacitors.</strong>
            <br>Capacitors A (8 µF) and B (4 µF) are connected in parallel. Their equivalent capacitance, $C_{AB}$, is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{AB} = C_A + C_B = 8 \mu\text{F} + 4 \mu\text{F} = 12 \mu\text{F} $$</div>
            
            <p><strong>Step 2: Combine series capacitors.</strong>
            <br>The combination $C_{AB}$ is in series with capacitor C (4 µF). The total equivalent capacitance of the circuit, $C_{eq}$, is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ \frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_{AB}} + \frac{1}{C_C} = \frac{1}{12 \mu\text{F}} + \frac{1}{4 \mu\text{F}} = \frac{1+3}{12 \mu\text{F}} = \frac{4}{12 \mu\text{F}} = \frac{1}{3 \mu\text{F}} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = 3 \mu\text{F} $$</div>
            
            <p><strong>Step 3: Find the total charge.</strong>
            <br>The total charge $Q_{total}$ supplied by the 12 V battery is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ Q_{total} = C_{eq} V = (3 \mu\text{F}) \times (12 \text{ V}) = 36 \mu\text{C} $$</div>

            <p><strong>Step 4: Find the charge on each capacitor.</strong>
            <br>This total charge flows through the series part of the circuit, which is capacitor C. Therefore, the charge on capacitor C is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ Q_C = Q_{total} = 36 \mu\text{C} $$</div>
            <p>The potential difference across capacitor C is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ V_C = \frac{Q_C}{C_C} = \frac{36 \mu\text{C}}{4 \mu\text{F}} = 9 \text{ V} $$</div>
            <p>The remaining voltage from the battery appears across the parallel combination of A and B:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ V_{AB} = V_{total} - V_C = 12 \text{ V} - 9 \text{ V} = 3 \text{ V} $$</div>
            <p>Since A and B are in parallel, they both have this potential difference across them. Now we can find their charges:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ Q_A = C_A V_{AB} = (8 \mu\text{F}) \times (3 \text{ V}) = 24 \mu\text{C} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ Q_B = C_B V_{AB} = (4 \mu\text{F}) \times (3 \text{ V}) = 12 \mu\text{C} $$</div>
            <p>The charges are: $Q_A = \mathbf{24 \mu C}$, $Q_B = \mathbf{12 \mu C}$, and $Q_C = \mathbf{36 \mu C}$.</p>

            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>Given $C_1=4.0 \mu$F and $C_2=6.0 \mu$F.</p>
            <p>The diagram shows a combination of capacitors. Let's analyze the connections.</p>
            <p>The capacitors are arranged in a repeating pattern. This is a common type of problem that can be solved by assuming the equivalent capacitance of the infinite ladder is $C_{eq}$. Then, if we add one more section to the ladder, the equivalent capacitance should still be $C_{eq}$.</p>
            <p>Let the equivalent capacitance between A and B be $C_{eq}$.</p>
            <p>The first section consists of a $C_1$ capacitor in the top branch, a $C_1$ capacitor in the bottom branch, and a $C_2$ capacitor connecting the middle points.</p>
            <p>Let's redraw the first repeating unit and replace the rest of the infinite ladder with $C_{eq}$.</p>
            <p>The circuit can be seen as $C_1$ in series with a parallel combination of $C_2$ and the rest of the ladder ($C_{eq}$). This entire combination is then in parallel with another $C_1$. This is not directly obvious from the diagram.</p>
            <p>Let's re-interpret the diagram as a repeating unit of two $C_1$ capacitors in series, and a $C_2$ capacitor in parallel with one of the $C_1$s. This is also not clear.</p>
            <p>The image provided for Problem 9 (31-E3) is a specific circuit diagram. It shows two parallel branches, each containing a capacitor $C_1$. These two parallel branches are then in series with a capacitor $C_2$. This is not an infinite ladder. The image for Problem 28 (31-E17) is an infinite ladder. The question for Problem 9 refers to figure (31-E3), which is not an infinite ladder. The question for Problem 28 refers to figure (31-E17), which is an infinite ladder.</p>
            <p>Let's assume the question for Problem 9 refers to the diagram provided with it, which is a simple series-parallel combination.</p>
            <p>The diagram for Problem 9 (31-E3) shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two capacitors of $C_1$ (4.0 µF) are in parallel. Let their equivalent be $C_{parallel} = C_1 + C_1 = 4.0 + 4.0 = 8.0 \mu\text{F}$.</li>
                <li>This $C_{parallel}$ is then in series with a capacitor $C_2$ (6.0 µF).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, the equivalent capacitance $C_{eq}$ is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ \frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_{parallel}} + \frac{1}{C_2} = \frac{1}{8.0 \mu\text{F}} + \frac{1}{6.0 \mu\text{F}} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ \frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{3 + 4}{24 \mu\text{F}} = \frac{7}{24} (\mu\text{F})^{-1} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = \frac{24}{7} \mu\text{F} \approx 3.43 \mu\text{F} $$</div>
            <p>The equivalent capacitance of the combination is approximately <strong>3.43 µF</strong>.</p>

            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>This is an infinite ladder circuit. Let the equivalent capacitance of the entire ladder between points A and B be $C_{eq}$. Since the ladder is infinite, adding one more repeating section to the front of the ladder will not change the total equivalent capacitance.</p>
            <p>The repeating section consists of a 2 µF capacitor in series with the main line, and another 2 µF capacitor in parallel (across the line).</p>
            <p>Let's model the circuit. The first 2 µF capacitor (let's call it $C_s$) is in series with a parallel combination. This parallel combination consists of the second 2 µF capacitor ($C_p$) and the rest of the infinite ladder, which itself has a capacitance of $C_{eq}$.</p>
            <p>The capacitance of the parallel part is $C_{parallel} = C_p + C_{eq} = (2 + C_{eq}) \mu\text{F}$.</p>
            <p>The total capacitance $C_{eq}$ is the series combination of $C_s$ and $C_{parallel}$.</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = \frac{C_s \times C_{parallel}}{C_s + C_{parallel}} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = \frac{2 \times (2 + C_{eq})}{2 + (2 + C_{eq})} = \frac{4 + 2C_{eq}}{4 + C_{eq}} $$</div>
            <p>Now, we solve this equation for $C_{eq}$:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq}(4 + C_{eq}) = 4 + 2C_{eq} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ 4C_{eq} + C_{eq}^2 = 4 + 2C_{eq} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq}^2 + 2C_{eq} - 4 = 0 $$</div>
            <p>This is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. We use the quadratic formula to solve for $C_{eq}$:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)} $$</div>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{5} $$</div>
            <p>Since capacitance must be a positive physical quantity, we take the positive root:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} = (\sqrt{5} - 1) \mu\text{F} $$</div>
            <p>Using $\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236$, the equivalent capacitance is:</p>
            <div class="math-eq">$$ C_{eq} \approx (2.236 - 1) \mu\text{F} = 1.236 \mu\text{F} $$</div>
