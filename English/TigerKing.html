        <p><strong>Theme: Satire on the Conceit and Folly of those in Power</strong></p>
        <p>"The Tiger King" by Kalki is a sharp political satire that critiques the arrogance, tyranny, and whims of autocrats. The story uses the Maharaja of Pratibandapuram's obsessive quest to kill one hundred tigers to defy a prophecy as a vehicle to expose the absurdities of absolute power. It highlights how the vanity and foolishness of a ruler can lead to the neglect of their duties, the suffering of their subjects, and the senseless destruction of nature.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sub-Themes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Man vs. Nature:</strong> The story serves as a commentary on humanity's reckless and destructive attitude towards wildlife, driven by pride and sport.</li>
            <li><strong>Pride and Hubris:</strong> The Maharaja's hubris in believing he can overcome his destiny (the prophecy) ultimately leads to his ironic and pathetic downfall.</li>
            <li><strong>Power and Sycophancy:</strong> The narrative satirizes the sycophantic behavior of minions and officials who, out of fear, enable the ruler's follies instead of offering wise counsel.</li>
            <li><strong>Irony of Fate:</strong> A central theme is the inescapable nature of fate. Despite all his efforts to control his destiny, the king is ultimately killed, not by a fearsome tiger, but by a tiny, inanimate wooden one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="plot">Plot Summary</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Prophecy:</strong> At the birth of the crown prince of Pratibandapuram, the chief astrologer predicts that while the prince will be a great warrior, his death will come from a tiger. The ten-day-old infant miraculously speaks, challenging the prophecy and declaring, "Let tigers beware!" This earns him the name "The Tiger King."</li>
            <li><strong>The Vow:</strong> Upon becoming Maharaja, he remembers the prophecy and embarks on a mission to kill one hundred tigers to prove it wrong. He bans tiger hunting for everyone else in his state.</li>
            <li><strong>The Hunt and its Obstacles:</strong> The Maharaja successfully kills seventy tigers in his own forests. When the tiger population becomes extinct, he marries a princess from a state with a large tiger population to continue his quest. He kills twenty-nine more tigers, bringing his tally to ninety-nine.</li>
            <li><strong>The Hundredth Tiger:</strong> The Maharaja grows desperate to find the final tiger. His dewan, fearing the king's rage, secretly arranges for an old, weak tiger from a park in Madras and releases it in the forest. The Maharaja shoots at it, and the tiger collapses. Believing his mission is complete, he leaves in triumph.</li>
            <li><strong>The Deception:</strong> The hunters discover the tiger only fainted from the shock of the bullet. Fearing the king's wrath, they kill the tiger themselves and present it to the Maharaja, who remains unaware of the deception.</li>
            <li><strong>The Ironic End:</strong> A few days later, while playing with his son, the Maharaja gets a sliver from a poorly crafted wooden toy tiger in his hand. The minor wound becomes infected, the infection spreads, and despite an operation by famous surgeons, the Tiger King dies.</li>
            <li><strong>The Final Irony:</strong> The narrator concludes that in this manner, the hundredth tiger—the wooden one—took its final revenge upon the Tiger King, thus fulfilling the prophecy.</li>

        <h3 id="key-points">Key Points</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Maharaja (The Tiger King):</strong> The protagonist, a conceited, stubborn, and whimsical ruler obsessed with defying a prophecy by killing 100 tigers.</li>
            <li><strong>The Prophecy:</strong> The central conflict of the story; the prediction that the king's death would be caused by a tiger.</li>
            <li><strong>The Dewan:</strong> The king's chief minister, a classic sycophant who enables the king's madness out of fear for his own life and job.</li>
            <li><strong>Satire:</strong> The story uses humor, exaggeration, and irony to mock the foolishness of those in power and the corrupting nature of absolute authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Dramatic Irony:</strong> A key literary device used throughout. The reader is often aware of truths that the characters (especially the King) are not, such as the fact that he did not kill the hundredth tiger.</li>
            <li><strong>The Wooden Tiger:</strong> The ultimate symbol of irony. The king, who killed 99 real tigers, is brought down by a cheap, inanimate toy tiger, highlighting the futility of his arrogant quest.</li>

        <div class="question-box">
            <strong>1. The story is a satire on the conceit of those in power. How does the author employ the literary device of dramatic irony in the story?</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                The author employs the literary device of dramatic irony with masterful precision to construct a potent satire on monarchical conceit. This is achieved by creating a persistent epistemic asymmetry between the reader's awareness and the protagonist's profound ignorance, thereby accentuating his hubris and ultimate folly.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Illusion of Invincibility:</strong> The Maharaja operates under the grandiose delusion that he is a "hero of heroes," an entity capable of subverting his own preordained destiny. The reader, however, is privy from the opening paragraph to the fact of the King's demise, a foreknowledge that renders his entire monomaniacal quest a futile and deeply ironic spectacle from its very inception.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Episode of the Hundredth Tiger:</strong> The most salient manifestation of dramatic irony occurs with the purported killing of the centenary tiger. The King, swelling with pride, believes he has achieved his magnum opus and vanquished fate. The reader, in concert with the craven hunters, is cognizant of the truth: the royal bullet missed its mark, and the senile tiger merely succumbed to syncope. His subsequent triumphant procession with a beast he failed to dispatch represents the very zenith of this dramatic irony.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Proximate Cause of Demise:</strong> The King, obsessed with eluding mortality at the claws of a living tiger, remains blissfully oblivious to the latent peril posed by a crudely fashioned wooden plaything. The reader bears witness to this final, fatal oversight, a circumstance that renders his death a denouement of both tragic and exquisitely absurd irony.</li>
                </ul>

            <strong>2. What is the author's indirect comment on subjecting innocent animals to the willfulness of human beings?</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                The author's indirect commentary constitutes a scathing indictment of humanity's callous and profoundly arrogant dominion over the animal kingdom. The Tiger King's sanguinary quest is not motivated by primal necessity or self-preservation, but is propelled entirely by his solipsistic ego and a vainglorious ambition to defy a celestial prognostication. He systematically orchestrates the extirpation of the tiger populations within his own and his father-in-law's territories, exhibiting no discernible remorse. The narrative deliberately frames this mass extermination not as a heroic exploit but as a senseless and vulgar slaughter, driven by one man's vanity. The exquisitely ironic conclusion, wherein nature (symbolically embodied by the lignified remains of a tree) exacts its retribution through an inanimate toy, serves to posit that such willful destruction of innocent life is, in the final analysis, an act of self-immolation.

            <strong>3. How would you describe the behaviour of the Maharaja's minions towards him? Do you find them truly sincere or are they driven by fear?</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                The minions of the Maharaja are entirely bereft of sincerity; their behaviour is a textbook illustration of craven sycophancy, motivated exclusively by an existential dread of their autocrat.
                <ul>
                    <li>The dewan, his chief minister, exists in a state of perpetual trepidation for his professional tenure and his very life, a fear that compels him to procure first a suitable bride for the king and later, in a fit of desperation, a senescent tiger to placate his master's whims.</li>
                    <li>The hunters, terrified of unemployment, conspire to fabricate the death of the hundredth tiger, choosing deceit over the risk of facing the monarch's displeasure.</li>
                    <li>The shopkeeper articulates a wildly exorbitant price for a shoddily made toy, fearing punishment under the draconian "rules of the Emergency."</li>
                </ul>
                This dynamic is a direct analogue to behaviours observable in numerous contemporary political orders, wherein subordinates are wont to engage in obsequious flattery and unquestioning obedience towards powerful leaders, motivated by a rational fear of reprisal rather than a desire to offer veracious counsel.

            <strong>4. Can you relate instances of game-hunting among the rich and the powerful in the present times that illustrate the callousness of human beings towards wildlife?</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes, lamentably, contemporary analogues of illicit game-hunting and poaching, perpetrated by affluent and influential individuals, continue to manifest. High-profile legal cases periodically emerge wherein prominent figures stand accused of hunting endangered species—such as blackbucks, tigers, or elephants—not out of necessity but for the profligate indulgence of sport, thrill-seeking, or the acquisition of trophies. Such endeavours frequently involve the leveraging of wealth and influence to circumvent legal proscriptions and gain access to protected reserves. These actions demonstrate a profound callousness and a supercilious conviction that they operate above the rule of law, directly echoing the Tiger King's own attitude that his personal desiderata supersede the ecological welfare of the natural world.

            <strong>5. We need a new system for the age of ecology... Discuss.</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                The narrative of "The Tiger King" serves as a potent and compelling argument for the urgent institution of a new paradigm for the "age of ecology." The King's actions, impelled by personal vanity, culminate in the utter extirpation of tigers from his domain, a stark demonstration of the devastating consequences of an anthropocentric worldview. A new, requisite system must be fundamentally ecocentric, predicated on the recognition that humanity is not the master of the planet but rather an integral constituent of a complex, interconnected biosphere.
            <br><br>
            The implementation of such a system would necessitate:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultivation of Empathy and Respect:</strong> A fundamental philosophical shift towards valuing the intrinsic well-being of all living organisms and their ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishment of Sustainable Policies:</strong> The promulgation of laws and governmental policies that unequivocally prioritize environmental conservation over short-term economic gains or individual caprice.</li>
                <li><strong>Unyielding Accountability:</strong> A rigorous framework for holding individuals and corporate entities, particularly those in positions of power, accountable for acts of environmental degradation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pedagogical Imperatives:</strong> The fostering of comprehensive environmental awareness from an early age, thereby instilling a sense of planetary stewardship in successive generations.</li>
            </ul>
            The adoption of such a holistic system is indispensable for the long-term viability and health of both the planet and humanity itself.

        <strong>1. What was the "great miracle" that took place when the Tiger King was just ten days old?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The great miracle consisted of an astounding display of precocious linguistic faculty by the ten-day-old infant, Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur. He not only articulated coherent speech but posed intelligent interrogatives, audaciously challenging the court astrologers to specify the precise modality of his prophesied demise, thereby astonishing all who were present.

        <strong>2. What did the State astrologer predict would be the cause of the Maharaja's death?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The chief astrologer prognosticated that, owing to the prince's birth under the celestial sign of the Bull—a zodiacal entity that stands as an implacable cosmic adversary to the Tiger—his ultimate demise would be precipitated by a tiger.

        <strong>3. How did the Maharaja try to avert the danger from a British officer?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            To forestall the encroachment of a high-ranking British officer intent on hunting within his state, and thereby circumvent the potential loss of his kingdom, the Maharaja executed a diplomatic gambit involving pecuniary appeasement. He dispatched approximately fifty expensive diamond rings to the officer's consort, anticipating her selection of one or two. Her avarice led her to retain the entire collection, costing the exchequer three lakh rupees, a sum the Maharaja considered a small price for the preservation of his throne.

    <div class="question-box">
        <strong>4. Why did the Maharaja decide to get married?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The Maharaja resolved to enter into a matrimonial alliance upon the complete extirpation of the tiger population within his own kingdom. The singular and overriding objective of this marriage was to identify a princess from a state boasting a substantial number of tigers, thereby facilitating the continuation of his quest to achieve a tally of one hundred kills.

    <div class="question-box">
        <strong>5. Why was the dewan in danger of losing his job?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The dewan's professional tenure was rendered exceedingly tenuous when the Maharaja failed to locate the hundredth tiger. The monarch's fury and obstinacy escalated to an alarming degree, culminating in a threat to the dewan: "In that case you may resign from your post." The dewan recognized with absolute clarity that securing a tiger was imperative for his professional survival.

    <div class="question-box">
        <strong>6. Why did the hunters decide not to tell the Maharaja that the 100th tiger was not dead?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The hunters collectively resolved to conceal the truth from the Maharaja as a calculated act of self-preservation, fearing the immediate loss of their employment. They correctly surmised that were the king to discover his shot had failed to find its mark, his fury would be formidable. To protect their livelihoods, they summarily dispatched the fainted animal and perpetuated the deception.

        <strong>7. How did the hundredth tiger take its revenge?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The centenary tiger that ultimately precipitated the King's ignominious demise was, in fact, a wooden effigy. A minuscule splinter of lignified material, a "sliver," from this crudely fashioned toy pierced the King's hand. The resultant wound developed a suppurating infection of catastrophic severity, which spread throughout his arm and led to his death, thus fulfilling the prophecy through a sublime and fatal twist of irony.

        <strong>8. What is the author's tone throughout the story?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The author's prevailing tone is one of mordant satire, maintained through a facade of mock-gravitas. He chronicles fantastical and absurd events with a deadpan solemnity, employing literary devices such as hyperbole and litotes to ridicule the monarch's arrogance, the court's obsequiousness, and the sheer irrationality of the entire enterprise.

    <h4 id="extra-long">Long Answer Questions</h4>
    <div class="question-box">
        <strong>1. "The Tiger King" is a story about the crime of killing animals for sport and pleasure. Discuss the ethical issues raised by the king's obsession and how the story serves as a cautionary tale.</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            "The Tiger King" serves as a profound and incisive critique of the anthropocentric worldview, wherein human desires, particularly the caprices of the powerful, are elevated above the intrinsic value of other species. The Maharaja's monomaniacal hunt is not impelled by any discernible need but by a solipsistic ego and a vainglorious ambition to conquer his own fate. This premise raises fundamental ethical questions regarding the supposed right of humanity to dominate and annihilate the natural world for personal gratification.
            <br><br>
            From an ethical standpoint, the king's actions are unequivocally reprehensible. He single-handedly orchestrates the extirpation of an entire species across two sovereign states merely to appease his vanity. The narrative deliberately frames this carnage not as a feat of courage but as a "slaughter," thereby underscoring its utter senselessness. The story implicitly highlights the suffering of the tigers and the catastrophic imbalance inflicted upon the ecosystem. Furthermore, the king's obsession leads to a dereliction of his gubernatorial duties; he disregards matters of state, tyrannizes his subordinates, and even undertakes a matrimonial alliance for the sole purpose of gaining access to more tigers. This illustrates how a flagrant disregard for animal life often correlates with a similar disregard for human well-being.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, the story functions as a potent cautionary narrative. The king's ironic demise—caused not by a fearsome beast of prey but by a splinter from a wooden toy—delivers a form of poetic justice. It powerfully suggests that nature, through its own inscrutable mechanisms, will invariably have the final word. The tale serves as a stark warning that hubris and a violent disregard for the natural order will ultimately precipitate one's own downfall, often in an unforeseen and ignominious fashion. It is a powerful argument for a more harmonious and respectful coexistence between humanity and the wider biosphere.

    <div class="question-box">
        <strong>2. Analyze the role of the dewan and other state officials in "The Tiger King." How do they contribute to the satire on power and governance?</strong>
        <div class="answer">
            The dewan and his fellow officials in "The Tiger King" are instrumental cogs in the story's satirical machinery, embodying the craven sycophancy and pervasive fear that characterize an autocratic regime. They are not depicted as characters possessing individual agency but rather as distorted reflections of the king's tyrannical power. Their actions serve to illuminate how absolute power corrupts not merely the ruler but the entire apparatus of governance that surrounds him.
            <br><br>
            The dewan stands as the archetypal servile subordinate. He never once questions the patent absurdity of the king's mission. Instead, he actively facilitates it, motivated by a palpable fear for his life and position. His desperate and ludicrous actions—arranging a marriage based on tiger population statistics and orchestrating the smuggling of a senile tiger from a park—are comical yet function as a deep critique of a system wherein officials prioritize the appeasement of the ruler over the welfare of the state. The moment the dewan, fearing the king wishes to marry him, nonsensically babbles about his pre-existing spousal commitments, is a moment of high comedic genius that underscores his absolute terror and the evisceration of rational thought in the monarch's presence.
            <br><br>
            Similarly, the hunters who prevaricate about the hundredth tiger's death and the shopkeeper who inflates the price of a worthless toy do so from a position of fear. Their behaviour demonstrates a complete systemic collapse of integrity and truth in the face of tyranny. Through these characters, Kalki satirizes a mode of governance where obsequiousness supplants honest counsel and fear becomes the primary currency of power. The minions' unquestioning compliance enables the king's folly, rendering them complicit in his destructive quest and eventual tragicomic downfall. The story powerfully argues that a ruler is only as effective as his advisors, and a system predicated on fear is inexorably destined for absurd and tragic outcomes.
