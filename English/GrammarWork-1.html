            <strong>India is a land of diversity. One way in which it makes us feel proud of it is the number of festivals we enjoy. Write an article in about 200 words on 'Festivals of India'. You are Karan / Karuna.</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                <h5 style="text-align:center;">Festivals of India</h5>
                <p style="text-align:center;">- By Karan</p>
                <p>It is said that 'Greatness of a Culture can be found in its festivals.' India has proven every word of the saying right by being famously known as the 'land of festivals'.</p>
                <p>Through to this belief, scores and scores of festivals that bring happiness and joy all across the country. This is because of the diverse cultures that exist in this subcontinent. All these different cultures and religions get tied together in bonds of love with these invisible threads of celebrations.</p>
                <p>Every festival has a social, religious & mythological value. Accordingly, Dussehra has a great significance. Similarly, the Janmashtami festival has also a great religious and social significance. This is the occasion when lord Krishna was born to kill Kans and other demons and save the people from a great danger. This festival also teaches us how to fight evil & falsehood, and establish truth.</p>
                <p>On these festivals, people offer prayers to their deities, wear ethnic clothes and make merry with their near & dear ones. Ganesh Chaturthi, Eid ul-Fitr, Baisakhi, Onam, Pongal, Gurupurab, Ram Navami & Durga Puja are some of the festivals that are celebrated with immense... in different parts of India. With some of these being specific to a particular region.</p>
                <p>No wonder our country is called a land of festivals & hope such festivities continue in future also despite of the loss of culture & tradition.</p>

            <strong>The media shows things which range from interesting to questionable. One of the ways in which they project beauty is through women. Write an article on how media influence the life of women, specially teenage girls in around 200 words. You are Rahul / Rahani.</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                <h5 style="text-align:center;">Media Influence On Teens</h5>
                <p style="text-align:center;">- By Rahul</p>
                <p>The media has a strong impact on shaping people's thoughts and beliefs, especially when it comes to beauty and appearance. From television shows to social media platforms, women are often portrayed in ways that suggest how they 'should' look or behave. Beauty is shown as being only about slim bodies, flawless skin & expensive fashion.</p>
                <p>Teenage girls, who are still discovering themselves, are the most affected by these media images. At a young age, they may begin comparing themselves to models and influencers they see online. This often leads to low self-confidence, body image issues, and even mental health struggles. Many feel pressured to look perfect, just to feel accepted in school or social circles.</p>
                <p>Social media makes this pressure worse. With filters, likes, and followers, teens may start believing their worth depends on their looks or popularity. Some may try harmful beauty routines, strict diets etc. Only a few media campaigns promote body positivity.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the media must take responsibility for the messages it spreads. By showing real, diverse and unfiltered women, it can help teenage girls grow with confidence and self-love. True beauty should not be measured by trends but by being proud of who you are.</p>
